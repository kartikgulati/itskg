### The primary functionality of the VOYAGER is the combination of eCommerce and informational blog websites. 

There are three main end-users, and every user has their perspective. The first one is Admin, which has all the administrative functionalities related to the customer's order manipulation, a list of all the logged-in users and Blog management.

Whereas Logged users have the authority to purchase the travel package published by the Admin and can draft their own travel experiences in the form of the Blog for other travellers. 

The Guest Users can roam around the Voyager website and explore and read the travel blogs by users.


Technology used to develop the Website:```PHP 8 (With OOPs concepts)```,```JavaScript```,```CSS 3```,```HTML 5```, ```BootStrap```
